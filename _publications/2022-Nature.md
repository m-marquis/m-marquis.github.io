Abstract: In neural networks that store information in their connection weights, there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and stability. Connections must be plastic to incorporate new information, but if they are too plastic, stored information can be corrupted. A potential solution is to allow plasticity only during epochs when task-specific information is rich, based on a “when-to-learn” signal. We hypothesized that dopamine provides a when-to-learn signal that allows the brain’s spatial maps to update when new spatial information is available—that is, when an animal is moving. Here we show that the dopamine neurons innervating the _Drosophila_ head direction map are specifically active when the fly turns to change its head direction. Moreover, their activity scales with moment-to-moment fluctuations in rotational speed. Pairing dopamine release with a visual cue persistently strengthens the cue’s influence on head direction cells. Conversely, inhibiting these dopamine neurons decreases the influence of the cue. This mechanism should accelerate learning during moments when orienting movements are providing a rich stream of head direction information, allowing learning rates to be low at other times to protect stored information. Our results show how spatial learning in the brain can be compressed into discrete epochs where high learning rates are matched to high rates of information intake.
