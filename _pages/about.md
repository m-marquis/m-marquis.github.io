I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Rachel Wilson's lab](http://wilson.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, where I recently completed my PhD. I study the computational principles underlying brain function using *in vivo* neural recordings and neural circuit modeling, with a focus on the roles of dopamine in navigation and sensory processing.
